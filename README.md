# Pedro-Porteiro

# About the Project: üìö

This e-commerce was made as the final project of React Course from CoderHouse. <br>
It shows a gallery with different products and categories which can be used as filters.<br>
When choosing a product, more information will be shown and a counter to choose the amount you want to add to cart. After adding the desired product to cart, you can modify the amount or delete the product from cart. <br>
In cart view you'll see all the products you added, you can change the quantity for each item, remove the product from the cart, apply a promotional code (not implemented yet) or checkout. <br>
If you checkout, you'll be asked for some information (name, email, phone) which will be attached to the order.
If the order was placed succesfully, you'll be redirected to a new page with a confirmation message.
<br>
The project uses Firebase to store the data of the products and information of the orders.
